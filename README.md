## why main.exe?

### the main aim to build this was to merge command line interface with some extra functionality that we do in our day to day life such as browsing the internet. I already specified some url links which are given below.

1. ### `open insta` (open instagram)
2. ### `open yt` (open youtube)
3. ### `open reddit` (open reddit)
4. ### `open gh` (open github)
